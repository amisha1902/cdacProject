💇 Salon Management System
The Salon Management System is a full-stack web application that helps customers book salon services online while allowing salon owners and admins to manage salons, bookings, and users efficiently.
It replaces manual appointment booking with a fast, digital system that supports real-time scheduling, online payments, and role-based access.

🌟 What This Project Does
This system connects customers, salon owners, and admins on a single platform:
Customers can discover salons, book services, and manage appointments.
Salon owners can register salons, manage services, and handle bookings.
